Ganeti Web Manager configuration files
======================================

Separate configuration for Ganeti Web Manager project.

These files get pulled in by ``setup.sh`` installation script.  They contain
default configuration options set up for your convenience.

This is separated from GWM because:

1. end users should now use ``setup.sh`` script to install everything

2. *normal* settings got buried down in directories structure and we want to
   provide you with something handy and easy to reach.
